# Mobile-Architect-&-Programming

## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal of the event tracking app is to implement code and construct an innovative UI through the IDE, Android Studio. With this app, users can track upcoming or past events. This app was designed to address users of all kinds such as students who want to track their school events or wedding planners with their upcoming weddings. THe requirements of the ap include the CRUD operation where the user can create, read, update, and delete an event or events. Another requirement is the ability to log in or create an account if the user is new. 

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The screens in the app include a login, register, and home screen. Features include buttons, swiping methods, and creating or deleting buttons. My UI keeps users in mind by taking into account their perspective and what they would want to see in an event tracking app. 

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I was able to approach the process of coding my app by utilizing my assigned course readings and watching youtube tutorials. These helped me immensely but I encountered a few roadblocks that caused me to have an unfinished application. Despite the fact, I can apply the technqiue of designing the UI first then code after towards my future. 

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I tested to ensure my code was functional by running test usernames and passwords in the login and register form. I also purposely didnt insert sections such as the username or re-entering the password or even leaving the field empty. This process is important because it shows the developer what went wrong and what went right. IT also shows them what they need to fix in their code or xml layout. 

## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I honestly had to innovate throughout msot if not the entire development process. It was actually quite fun to do because it showed me the potential I have to build a mobile application. Since this was my first time laying my hands on an app IDE, it was a surreal experience. 

## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was particularly successful in the login and register components. I probably jumped in happiness after getting my code to run properly and in the way that I had wanted it to. I also think the UI of most of the xml layouts came out aesthetically pleasing. The spacing with the texts and buttons shows my skill and knowledge I gained throughout this course.
