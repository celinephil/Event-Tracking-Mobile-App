# Mobile-Architect-&-Programming

The goal of the event tracking app is to implement code and construct an innovative UI through the Android Studio IDE. With this app, users can track upcoming or past events. This app was designed to address users of all kinds such as students who want to track school events or wedding planners with upcoming weddings. The requirements of the app include the CRUD operation where the user has the ability to create, read, update, and delete an event(s). Another requirement is the ability to log in or create an account if the user is new. 

The screens in the app include a login, register, and home screen. Features include buttons, swiping methods, and create (+) or delete buttons. My UI keeps users in mind by taking into account their perspective and what they would want to see in an event tracking app. With conducting user stories, I was able to determine the best actionable plan for launching the application. 

I was able to approach the process of coding my app by utilizing readings, online resources, and tutorials. These immensely helped me but I encountered a few roadblocks that caused me to have an unfinished application. I tested to ensure my code was functional by running test usernames and passwords in the login and register form. I also purposely didnt insert sections such as the username or re-entering the password or even leaving the field empty. This process is important because it shows the developer what went wrong and what went right. It also shows them what they need to fix in their code or xml layout. I honestly had to innovate throughout most, if not the entire development process. It was actually quite fun to do because it showed me the potential I have to build a fully working mobile application. Since this was my first time laying my hands on a mobile application IDE, it was a surreal experience. 

I was particularly successful in the login and register components. I probably jumped in happiness after getting my code to run in the way that I had wanted it to. I also think the UI of most of the xml layouts came out aesthetically pleasing especially when keeping the user stories in mind. The spacing with the texts and buttons shows my skill and knowledge I gained throughout this course.
